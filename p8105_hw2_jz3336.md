## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trash Wheel data set:

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./hw2_data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls), 
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data for 2017 and 2018:

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./hw2_data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./hw2_data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

This data set contains information from the Mr. Trash Wheel Collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enter the inner harbor, the trash wheel
collect the trash, and store it in a dumpster. The data set contain
information on year, month, and trash collected, including some specific
kinds of trash. There are a total of 416 rows in ours final data set.
Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.

## Problem 2

#### Read the NYC transit data:

``` r
nyc_transit_df =
  read_csv("./hw2_data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_number"
  ) %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_location, route_name, route_number, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  rename(station_latitude_longitude = station_location, ada_compliance = ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)) %>% 
  arrange(route_name, route_number)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This data set contains information from the NYC transit data. First, I
used clean\_names function from the janitor package to clean up the
variable names. In order to use pivot\_longer to organize routes, I
changed values in route8 to route11 from numbers to characters with
mutate function. There are 11 routes in total, and each route has
different corresponding values, such as R, N, Q, and so on. I have
organized route1\~route11 with pivot\_longer function into the
route\_name variable, and the corresponding letters and numbers are
saved in route\_number. After tidying up the data set, I have select to
retain columns of the line, station, name, station latitude/longitude,
routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance from
the original data. In the end, the recode function was used within the
mutate function to change the entry from a character variable to a
logical variable. The dimension of the data set is \[20548, 9\], where
20548 is the number of rows, and 9 is the number of columns.

#### To answer questions about the NYC transit data:

``` r
distinct_nyc_transit_df =
  distinct(nyc_transit_df, line,station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

entry_no_vending = filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == "NO", entry == TRUE) %>% nrow()
no_vending = filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == "NO") %>% nrow()
percentage = entry_no_vending/no_vending
```

1.  The number of distinct stations is 465.
2.  The number of stations that are ADA compliant is 84.
3.  759 out of 2013 station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance. The proportion is 0.3770492.

There are 60 distinct stations served train A. There are 17 stations not
only serve train A but also ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

Read and clean the pols-month.csv:

``` r
pols_month = 
  read_csv("./hw2_data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.integer(month), year = as.integer(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

pols_month_tidy = 
  left_join(pols_month, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(president = 
           case_when(
             prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
             prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem")) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  select(year, month_name, president, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem)

##Another way that I have tried.
##gop_pols_month = 
##  filter(pols_month_tidy, prez_gop == 1) %>% 
##  mutate(prez_gop = as.character(prez_gop)) %>% 
##  mutate(prez_gop = recode(prez_gop, "1" = "gop")) %>% 
##  rename(president = prez_gop)
##
##dem_pols_month = 
##  filter(pols_month_tidy, prez_dem == 1) %>% 
##  mutate(prez_dem = as.character(prez_dem)) %>% 
##  mutate(prez_dem = recode(prez_dem, "1" = "dem")) %>% 
##  rename(president = prez_dem)
##
##president_pols_month_tidy =
##  bind_row(gop_pols_month, dem_pols_month)%>% 
##  select(year, month_name, president, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem) %>% 
##  arrange(year)
```

Read and clean the snp.csv data set:

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./hw2_data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.integer(month), year = as.integer(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

snp_df_tidy = 
  left_join(snp_df, month_df, by = "month") %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  select(year, month_name, close)
```

Read and clean the unemployment.csv:

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("./hw2_data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"),
    month_name = month.name
  )

unemployment_df_tidy = 
  left_join(unemployment_df, month_df, by = "month") %>%
  arrange(year) %>% 
  select(year, month_name, unemployment)
```

Join the three datasets:

``` r
final_df = 
  left_join(pols_month_tidy,snp_df_tidy, by = c("year","month_name")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_df_tidy, by = c("year","month_name"))
```

There were three datasets: pols\_month.csv, snp.csv, and
unemployment.csv.

The first pols\_moth.csv dataset contains information about national
politicians. To clean up the data set, I separate the “mon” variable
into “year”, “month” and day“. Then I create a month tibble and
left\_joint it to the pols\_month. By doing this, all numeric month will
be converted to character month in the full name. Next, I selected the
year, month\_name, president, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem,
sen\_dem, rep\_dem variables, and arranged them by year and month. These
variables indicate the number of Republican or Democratic governors,
senators, and representatives on the associated date. After clean up the
data set and rename it to pols\_month\_tidy, the dimension of the
cleaned data is \[822, 9\], where 822 is the number of rows and 9 is the
number of columns. The”president" variable is created to contain
democratic (dem) or republican (gop) at any given time. The year range
of this data set is 1947, 2015. The year range of the pols\_month\_tidy
is the largest among all three datasets. Therefore, when merging the
three datasets, there will be some NA value associate with the years
1947 and 1948.

The second snp.csv dataset contains information about Standard & Poor’s
stock market index (S\&P). To clean up the data set, I separate the
“date” variable into “year”, “month” and day“. Then, similar to
treating the pols\_month data, I create a month tibble and left\_joint
it to the snp. By doing this, all numeric month will be converted to
character month in the full name. There are only three variables after
cleaning up the snp data set, where the”close" variable indicates the
closing values of the S\&P stock index on the associated date. After
clean up the data set and rename it to snp\_df\_tidy, the dimension of
the cleaned data is \[787, 3\], where 787 is the number of rows and 3 is
the number of columns. The year range of this data set is 1950, 2015.

The third unemployment.csv dataset contains information about the
percentage of unemployment in the associate month of selected years. To
clean up the data set, I used pivot\_longer to combine all months
variable as “month” while putting the associate unemployment percentages
into the “unemployment” column. Then, I create a month tibble which
contain the lower-case abbreviation of each month and month.name
vectors. By left\_jointing this month tibble to the unemployment\_df,
all lower-case abbreviations of each month will be converted to
character month in the full name. There are only three variables after
cleaning up the unemployment data set, where the “unemployment” variable
indicates the percentage of unemployment in associate month of the
associated year. After clean up the data set and rename it to
unemployment\_df\_tidy, the dimension of the cleaned data is \[816, 3\],
where 816 is the number of rows and 3 is the number of columns. The year
range of this data set is 1948, 2015.

The final\_df is created by merging all three datasets by “year” and
“month\_name”. The dimension of the final\_df is \[822, 11\], where
822 is the number of rows and 11 is the number of columns. The year
range of this data set is 1947, 2015.
